# Image Classification Projects
This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks for various image classification tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The notebooks cover different datasets and techniques in image classification.

Notebooks
1. CIFAR-10 Image Classification
File: CIFAR_10_data_set_image_classification.ipynb
Description: This notebook demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
Created using: Google Colab
Date: 3 months ago
2. Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification
File: Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb
Description: Provides a comprehensive implementation of a CNN for image classification tasks. It covers different architectures and techniques for optimizing model performance.
